### Description
The Learn 2 Launch Scientific tracks are hands-on, deep technical explorations of emerging technology fields. In the spring of 2020 two tracks will be offered: AI and Blockchain. The classes aims to equip all students with a deep insight into the technologies, its capabilities, and  to seperate hype from reality. These are applied courses, where we will explain how AI / Blockchain technology works and how to actually apply it to solve problems.

The scientific tracks will be frontloaded in the semester, and the first two weeks of the L2L program will be taught in a bootcamp format with one or two lectures daily. Regular check-ins and guest lecturers will then run on a biweekly basis throughout the semester. Apart from regular lectures we'll also run student presentations, assignment check ups, and project mentoring / feedback sessions. Lastly, we'll have many guest lectures from industry and academia, as well as hands-on group exercises and presentation of use cases will help along the way.
