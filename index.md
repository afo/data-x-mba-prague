## Data-X VSE

**Course Dates**: Oct 21, 22, 24, 25


## Course description
The AI track will cover state-of-the art approaches for practical AI application development. We'll cover foundations, computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, generative adverserial networks, model deployment / maintenance, graph databases, and guest lectures will be given be AI entrepreneurs as well as researchers (at Uber and UC Berkeley).

## Resources and Prep-Material

#### Python training

Go through the training videos offered by Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS): [Link](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/python-boot-camp-fall-2016-training-videos-available-online)


#### Machine Learning Theory

Read through this excellent non-technical overview of Machine Learning and Data science: [Link](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/)


#### Install Instructions (Anaconda)

If you've never used Jupyter notebooks before I recommend that you either run code and course material in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Google's shared notebook interface in Drive.

If you want to run notebooks locally (recommended for simple experimentation) and you haven't used virtual environments or pyenv or similar before, then follow the install instructions here:

**Cloud Credits**
For students who need computing resources for the class project, it is recommended that you to look into AWS educate program for students or sign up for a Google Cloud account. You’ll get a couple of hundreds of dollar’s worth of sign up credit. Here are the links: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free/).
