## Course description
This course will teach you the commercial aspects of applied AI, data science, machine learning, and deep learning. At the same time you'll get a fundamental understanding of how to implement and build systems using state-of-the-art and open source tools.

## Resources and Prep-Material

#### Python training

Go through the training video offered by CS50: Introduction to Programming with Python by Harvard University x freeCodeCamp: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4)


#### Machine Learning Theory

Read through this excellent non-technical overview of Machine Learning and Data science: [Link](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/)


#### Install Instructions (Anaconda)

If you've never used Jupyter notebooks before I recommend that you either run code and course material in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Google's shared notebook interface in Drive.

If you want to run notebooks locally (recommended for simple experimentation) and you haven't used virtual environments or pyenv or similar before, then follow the install instructions here:

**Cloud Credits**
For students who need computing resources for the class project, it is recommended that you to look into AWS educate program for students or sign up for a Google Cloud account. You’ll get a couple of hundreds of dollar’s worth of sign up credit. Here are the links: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free/).
